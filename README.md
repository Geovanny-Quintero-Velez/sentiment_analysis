**Sentiment Analysis Project**

## Description

This project implements a sentiment analysis model using Python and machine learning libraries. It focuses on classifying texts according to their polarity, employing different modeling and data preprocessing approaches.

## Main Features

* Data preprocessing using `pandas` and `sklearn`.
* Implementation of classification models with `MLPClassifier` and `DummyClassifier`.
* Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as `accuracy_score`, `precision_score`, `f1_score`, `recall_score`, and `cohen_kappa_score`.

## Installation

To run this project, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install scikeras tabulate pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

Run the notebook in Jupyter to train and evaluate the models:

```bash
jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_CyED_Code.ipynb
```

## Dependencies

* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `scikeras`
* `tabulate`
